        "- Loan amount is incorporated as a key decision factor\n",
        "- Each model is trained in a separate code cell for selective execution\n",
        "- GPU acceleration for applicable models\n",
        "- Focused on Logistic Regression and XGBoost models\n",
        "- Inference can be run with either model for comparison\n",

        "\n",
        "Key features of this implementation:\n",
        "1. Loan amount is incorporated into the scoring algorithm and approval decision\n",
        "2. The system calculates a maximum recommended loan amount based on income and credit score\n",
        "3. Loan-to-income ratio is used as an additional risk factor\n",
        "4. The interactive calculator allows users to experiment with different loan amounts and see how they affect approval odds\n",
        "5. Both Logistic Regression and XGBoost models are available for comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach provides a more realistic and comprehensive credit assessment that considers not just the borrower's creditworthiness but also the specific loan amount requested."
